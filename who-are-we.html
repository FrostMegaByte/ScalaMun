							<h2>Who are we?</h2>
							<h3>ExComm</h3>
							<p>We are ExComm!<br>
								Hi guys! Nice to meet you, we are the Executive Committee for this year’s (2019) ScalaMUN! For many months we have been working on organising this conference for you. We hope to see you at our MUN conference in March!</p>

							<h3>Hélène de Beer</h3>
							<p>Hi! My name is Hélène de Beer and I am 16 years old. At the moment, I am in the fifth year of bilingual VWO at Scala College. To me, the debating is not the most important. I love the ambience around it and that all people around us are interested in all worldwide problems and come up with solutions for them. Also, what I absolutely adore is the MUN’s dress code. Next to MUN and ExComm, I love spending time with friends and family and playing tennis. Furthermore, I love travelling, which is mainly our theme and seeing new places all around the world.</p><br>

							<h3>Raemon van Geen</h3>
							<p>Hi and welcome to ScalaMUN! My name is Raemon van Geen, I am seventeen years old and I am in the fifth year of bilingual education. To me, browsing through UN Charters and regulations is the most satisfying thing to do during MUN as I discover all the new rules and discuss them with my fellow delegates. Being responsible for the topics and overall contents of the conference, I am excited to be part of the Executive Committee. In my spare time, I play the viola in orchestras or as a soloist and I spend seven hours a week at my swimming club as a swimmer and trainer.</p><br>

							<h3>Sarah Idrissi Sbai</h3>
							<p>Hello dear delegates! I’m Sarah Idrissi Sbai and I’m seventeen years old and I’m currently in my fifth year of Bilingual VWO at Scala College. I personally find the clothing to be most fun! Usually you would see all your fellow students dressed up in casual clothing, but to see everyone rock a suit and tie or formal wear is really cool! Besides it being funny to see an entire different side of your friends, it also really gives the conference the professional feel a regular UN meeting has too. Besides organising the conference I love to study other cultures and travel. I’m also very fond of singing and acting, so who knows what might happen during MUN Party…. ;)</p><br>

							<h3>Maartje Ouwerling</h3>
							<p>Hi everyone! Welcome to ScalaMUN 2019. My name is Maartje and I’m sixteen years old. Last year I joined MUN as a delegate, but for this school year I’ve decided to join the Executive Committee and to organise our upcoming conference. I honestly don’t really enjoy debating myself, but I really love being part of the great atmosphere of MUN and to see and hear what arguments other delegates come up with in their debates. I think that’s what I love the most about MUN: the creativity of other delegates and learning about different perspectives on a certain issue.<br>
							Besides MUN, I’m very interested in filmmaking and photography, as well as writing fiction. I’m currently working on a long science-fiction story. I enjoy playing the piano, the ukulele and singing as well.</p><br>
